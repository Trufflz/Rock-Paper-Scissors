#Rock Paper Scissors
One of the first programs I built while I was learning along with the C++ curriculum being taught to me in school. I created this program as a fun minigame for myself and my friends to play with.

The user is faced off with a generated computer bot who fights with the user in a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Depending on which option the user chooses, the program will display the chosen options of the user and computer, then decide who wins the game.
